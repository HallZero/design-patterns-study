Repository for studying design patterns and their implementation in different programming languages.

The basic structure of each Pattern contains a readme file with a brief explanation of the pattern and a folder with the implementation in a specific programming language.

The current structure of the repository is as follows:

```bash
.
├── creational
│   ├── 01-singleton
│   │   ├── go
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── 02-factory
│       ├── go
│       └── README.md
├── go.mod
└── README.md
```

For now, the examples are extracted directly from the [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) website. Check the website for more information about the patterns.
